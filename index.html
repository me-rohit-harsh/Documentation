                                    In earlier chapters, we’ve dealt mostly with functional React components that do not
                                    require state management. This chapter’s main focus is on state, its management, and
                                    components that utilize it in React.
                                </p>

                        <section class="section-1 main-section" id="section-1">
                            <header>What is State?</header>
                            <hr>
                            <p>
                                State is a JavaScript object that stores a component’s dynamic data and determines the
                                component’s behavior. Because state is dynamic, it enables a component to keep track of
                                changing information in between renders and for it to be dynamic and interactive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                State is similar to props but unlike props, it is private to a component and is
                                controlled solely by the said component. In the examples from previous chapters, the
                                behavior of components has primarily depended on the props that are passed down to them.
                                In those cases, the components that receive the props have no control over them because
                                props are read-only.

                                Adding state to the Greeting component above involves defining within the class
                                component, a constructor function that assigns the initial state using this.state.
                            </p>

                            <code>class <span class="keyword">Greeting</span> extends <span class="keyword">React.Component</span> {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        <span class="comment">// Define your state object here</span>
        <span class="keyword">this</span>.state = {
            name: '<span class="string">Jane Doe</span>'

                                The devtools are available for download on both Mozilla Firefox Add-ons and the Chrome
                                Web Store. Follow the appropriate link to install the devtools depending on which
                                browser you have installed on your computer.
                            </p>

                                Throughout the rest of this book, Chrome will be used as the browser of choice. In order
                                to confirm successful installation of the devtools on Chrome, open the developer tools
                                window using <span class="key-button">Cmd+Opt+I</span> on a Mac or <span
                                    class="key-button">Ctrl+Alt+I</span>
                                on a windows PC. You should now see a
